# AI Protocol: How to Read this Wiki

> [!info] For External Agents
> If you are an AI agent working in a different project but need context from this vault, follow this protocol to minimize token usage and maximize relevance.

## 1. The Three-Step Read
Do NOT read the entire vault. Follow these steps in order:
1. **Read [[hot]]**: This contains the "Active Context" and current rules of engagement.
2. **Read [[index]]**: Use this as your map to find relevant topics.
3. **Targeted Read**: Only once steps 1 and 2 fail, read specific files under `wiki/concepts/`, `wiki/entities/`, or `wiki/sources/`.

## 2. Formatting Rules
- **Bi-directional Links**: Always use `[[Note Name]]` for internal references.
- **Metadata**: Every note must have a "Created" date and "Session" link at the bottom.
- **Conciseness**: Prefer bullet points and structured sections over long paragraphs.

## 3. Interaction
- If you find a contradiction between two notes, flag it in the current conversation and update the notes with a `> [!warning] Contradiction Found` block.
- Always check `wiki/concepts/tech-stack/` for coding standards before suggesting implementations.
