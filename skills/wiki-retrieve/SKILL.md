# wiki-retrieve: BM25 Text Retrieval for Bunker OS

Search the wiki vault using BM25 — a pure text-based ranking algorithm.
Fast, deterministic, zero external dependencies. OpenCode reads the
ranked chunks and synthesizes the final answer.

**No embeddings. No LLM calls. No ollama. No API keys.**
The agent (OpenCode) is the only intelligence in the loop.

## Architecture

```
QUERY:
  query string
       │
       ▼
  python3 scripts/retrieve.py "<query>" --top 5
       │
       ├─ bm25-index.py (pure Python, stdlib only)
       │     tokenize → BM25 scoring → ranked results
       │
       └─ returns top-N with: path, score, preview
       │
       ▼
  OpenCode reads the pages and synthesizes the answer
```

The index is built offline from wiki Markdown files. Each page is
split into chunks (~500 tokens each) at paragraph boundaries. The
BM25 algorithm ranks chunks by term frequency/inverse document
frequency — the same foundation Elasticsearch uses.

## Feature Detection

Before using retrieve, check if the index exists:

```bash
python3 scripts/retrieve.py build   # build/update index
python3 scripts/retrieve.py status  # check status
```

If the index doesn't exist, fall back to `obsidian-vault_search_notes`
or the legacy hot → index → drill read order.

## Usage

| Operation | Command | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Search** | `python3 scripts/retrieve.py "query" --top 5` | BM25 ranked results |
| **Build** | `python3 scripts/retrieve.py build` | Rebuild index from scratch |
| **Status** | `python3 scripts/retrieve.py status` | Index stats |

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--top N` | `5` | Max results to return |

---

## Integration with OpenCode Queries

When you receive a query:

1. **First**: run `python3 scripts/retrieve.py status` to verify the index exists
2. **If it exists**: run `python3 scripts/retrieve.py "consulta" --top 5`
3. **Read the results**: each result has `path` (file path), `score` (BM25 relevance), and `preview` (text excerpt)
4. **Read the pages**: use `obsidian-vault_read_note` on the relevant paths
5. **Synthesize**: answer the user with citations to the wiki sources

If the index doesn't exist or the script fails:
- Use `obsidian-vault_search_notes` with the query
- Or read `wiki/hot.md` + `wiki/index.md` + relevant pages (legacy path)

---

## Index Maintenance

Rebuild the index after adding or modifying wiki pages:

```bash
# After ingesting new sources:
python3 scripts/retrieve.py build

# Verify status:
python3 scripts/retrieve.py status
```

The build is incremental-aware but rebuilds fully from source files.
It's fast (pure Python, no network calls). Run it before heavy
search sessions.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `python3 scripts/retrieve.py build` | Build/update BM25 index |
| `python3 scripts/retrieve.py status` | Index status and stats |
| `python3 scripts/retrieve.py "query" --top N` | BM25 text search |
| `obsidian-vault_search_notes` | Fallback FTS search (when BM25 not available) |
| `obsidian-vault_read_note` | Read wiki pages from search results |

## Why BM25-only?

- **Zero dependencies**: stdlib Python, no numpy, no ollama, no API keys
- **Fast**: builds and queries in under a second for typical vaults
- **Deterministic**: same query = same results, every time
- **OpenCode does the synthesis**: the agent reads the chunks and
  applies its own model (Anthropic, OpenAI, local — whatever the user
  configured in OpenCode) to understand and answer
- **Portable**: works in CI, air-gapped environments, anywhere with
  Python 3.10+
